*Shining standard of elegance*

## Project Overview
The Lumière Grand Hotel Management System is a web-based application developed for **Database Management Systems 1 (DBMS 1)** and **Systems Integration and Architecture (SIA)**. It manages hotel operations such as guests, rooms, reservations, employees, hotel services, service orders, inventory, and billing.

The system connects a MySQL database to a Node.js and Express.js REST API (MVC structure), which is consumed by an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend.

## Major Feature: Automatic Room Assignment and Availability Checking
When a reservation is made, the system checks room availability based on the selected room type, guest capacity, and reservation dates. It then automatically assigns an available room that meets the booking requirements. This prevents overlapping reservations and makes booking faster and more reliable.

## Technologies Used
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js (MVC) |
| Database | MySQL |
| API | REST API (JSON) |
| Version Control | Git and GitHub |

## Features
- Guest Management and Reviews
- Room, Housekeeping, and Maintenance Management
- Reservation Management with Automatic Room Assignment
- Employee and Position Management
- Hotel Service and Service Order Management
- Inventory Management
- Billing and Payment Records
- SQL JOIN Reports

## Database Design
The system uses a relational MySQL database of **16 tables** with primary keys, foreign keys, and field validation.

### Entity Relationship Diagram

### Database Script
The schema and sample data are in [`database/hotel_management.sql`](database/hotel_management.sql).

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL Server
- Git

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ortizrattanuel0601-coder/hotel-management-system-DBMS-final-project---group-5-section-D.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in VS Code or a terminal.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root using the required environment variable names from the project configuration. Do not commit actual passwords or credentials.
5. Create the database and import the SQL script:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE hotel_management;"
   mysql -u root -p hotel_management < database/hotel_management.sql
   ```
6. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
7. Open `http://localhost:1234` in your browser.

## API Endpoints

Main resources (each supports `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`/`PATCH`, and `DELETE`):

| Resource | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Guests | `/api/guests` |
| Rooms | `/api/rooms` |
| Reservations | `/api/reservations` |
| Employees | `/api/employees` |
| Services | `/api/services` |
| Service Orders | `/api/service-orders` |

JOIN report endpoints (`GET`):

| Report | Endpoint | JOIN Type |
|---|---|---|
| Guest Reviews | `/api/reports/guest-reviews` | LEFT JOIN |
| Room Operations | `/api/reports/room-operations` | INNER + LEFT JOIN |
| Reservation Details | `/api/reports/reservation-details` | LEFT JOIN |
| Employee Positions | `/api/reports/employee-positions` | INNER JOIN |
| Service Orders | `/api/reports/service-orders` | INNER + LEFT JOIN |

*Note: Pontunila (DBMS 1 only) and Palmis (SIA only) share the Employee Management slice, so the group has 6 working slots across the two courses.*

## Git Collaboration Rules
- Work on your own feature branch (e.g., `feature/name-purpose`).
- Commit from your own machine with clear messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`).
- Open a Pull Request to merge into `main`; nobody pushes directly to `main`.
- Have a teammate review each PR.
- Merge using **"Create a merge commit"** (no squash).
- Do not commit `.env`, database passwords, or `node_modules`.

## Project Status
Completed and ready for final submission.
- Service Order Management
- Reports using SQL JOIN queries
